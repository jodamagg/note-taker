# NoteApp
Project to reconfigure and repair existing code for a note taking app. Built an Express server with a JSON.DB. Defined several get routes, a post route, and a delete route. Fixed issues with JS and CSS files linking incorrectly due to bad file paths. Full functionality now restored. App is deployed live on Heroku here:
